### A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to classify data instances based on their feature values. It works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the most informative features, ultimately leading to predictions at the leaf nodes. 

- Decision trees are easy to understand and visualize, making them useful for explaining the decision-making process.
Handling both numerical and categorical data:
- A Decision Tree Classifier is a type of algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to classify instances based on their feature value
â€” Decision Tree Classifier is a method used to classify data into categories like "Yes" or "No".

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression
