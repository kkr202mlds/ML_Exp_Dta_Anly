### The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point

KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification, while K means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used with the intention of clustering data points.
